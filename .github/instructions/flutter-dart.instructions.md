*   DO start doc comments with a single-sentence summary.
*   DO separate the first sentence of a doc comment into its own paragraph.
*   AVOID redundancy with the surrounding context.
*   PREFER starting comments of a function or method with third-person verbs if its main purpose is a side effect.
*   PREFER starting a non-boolean variable or property comment with a noun phrase.
*   PREFER starting a boolean variable or property comment with "Whether" followed by a noun or gerund phrase.
*   PREFER a noun phrase or non-imperative verb phrase for a function or method if returning a value is its primary purpose.
*   DON'T write documentation for both the getter and setter of a property.
*   PREFER starting library or type comments with noun phrases.
*   CONSIDER including code samples in doc comments.
*   DO use square brackets in doc comments to refer to in-scope identifiers.

#### Usage

##### Libraries

*   DO use strings in `part of` directives.
*   DON'T import libraries that are inside the `src` directory of another package.
*   DON'T allow an import path to reach into or out of `lib`.
*   PREFER relative import paths.

##### Null

*   DON'T explicitly initialize variables to `null`.
*   DON'T use an explicit default value of `null`.
*   DON'T use `true` or `false` in equality operations.
*   AVOID `late` variables if you need to check whether they are initialized.
*   CONSIDER type promotion or null-check patterns for using nullable types.

##### Strings

*   DO use adjacent strings to concatenate string literals.
*   PREFER using interpolation to compose strings and values.
*   AVOID using curly braces in interpolation when not needed.

##### Collections

*   DO use collection literals when possible.
*   DON'T use `.length` to see if a collection is empty.
*   AVOID using `Iterable.forEach()` with a function literal.
*   DON'T use `List.from()` unless you intend to change the type of the result.
*   DO use `whereType()` to filter a collection by type.

##### Functions

##### Error handling

*   AVOID catches without `on` clauses.
*   DON'T discard errors from catches without `on` clauses.
*   DO throw objects that implement `Error` only for programmatic errors.
*   DON'T explicitly catch `Error` or types that implement it.
*   DO use `rethrow` to rethrow a caught exception.

##### Asynchrony

*   PREFER async/await over using raw futures.
*   DON'T use `async` when it has no useful effect.
*   CONSIDER using higher-order methods to transform a stream.
*   AVOID using Completer directly.

*   AVOID abbreviations.
*   PREFER putting the most descriptive noun last.
*   CONSIDER making the code read like a sentence.
*   PREFER a noun phrase for a non-boolean property or variable.
*   PREFER a non-imperative verb phrase for a boolean property or variable.
*   CONSIDER omitting the verb for a named boolean parameter.
*   PREFER the "positive" name for a boolean property or variable.
*   PREFER an imperative verb phrase for a function or method whose main purpose is a side effect.
*   PREFER a noun phrase or non-imperative verb phrase for a function or method if returning a value is its primary purpose.
*   CONSIDER an imperative verb phrase for a function or method if you want to draw attention to the work it performs.
*   AVOID starting a method name with `get`.
*   PREFER naming a method `to...()` if it copies the object's state to a new object.
*   PREFER naming a method `as...()` if it returns a different representation backed by the original object.
*   AVOID describing the parameters in the function's or method's name.
*   DO follow existing mnemonic conventions when naming type parameters.

##### Libraries

*   PREFER making declarations private.
*   CONSIDER declaring multiple classes in the same library.

##### Classes and mixins

*   AVOID defining a one-member abstract class when a simple function will do.
*   AVOID defining a class that contains only static members.
*   AVOID extending a class that isn't intended to be subclassed.
*   DO use class modifiers to control if your class can be extended.
*   AVOID implementing a class that isn't intended to be an interface.
*   DO use class modifiers to control if your class can be an interface.
*   PREFER defining a pure `mixin` or pure `class` to a `mixin class`.

##### Constructors

*   CONSIDER making your constructor `const` if the class supports it.

##### Members

*   PREFER making fields and top-level variables `final`.
*   DO use getters for operations that conceptually access properties.
*   DO use setters for operations that conceptually change properties.
*   DON'T define a setter without a corresponding getter.
*   AVOID using runtime type tests to fake overloading.
*   AVOID public `late final` fields without initializers.
*   AVOID returning nullable `Future`, `Stream`, and collection types.
*   AVOID returning `this` from methods just to enable a fluent interface.

##### Types

*   DO type annotate variables without initializers.
*   DO type annotate fields and top-level variables if the type isn't obvious.
*   DON'T redundantly type annotate initialized local variables.
*   DO annotate return types on function declarations.
*   DO annotate parameter types on function declarations.
*   DON'T annotate inferred parameter types on function expressions.

*   AVOID writing incomplete generic types.
*   DO annotate with `dynamic` instead of letting inference fail.
*   PREFER signatures in function type annotations.
*   DON'T specify a return type for a setter.
*   DON'T use the legacy typedef syntax.
*   PREFER inline function types over typedefs.
*   PREFER using function type syntax for parameters.
*   AVOID using `dynamic` unless you want to disable static checking.
*   DO use `Future<void>` as the return type of asynchronous members that do not produce values.
*   AVOID using `FutureOr<T>` as a return type.

##### Parameters

*   AVOID positional boolean parameters.
*   AVOID optional positional parameters if the user may want to omit earlier parameters.
*   AVOID mandatory parameters that accept a special "no argument" value.
*   DO use inclusive start and exclusive end parameters to accept a range.

##### Equality

*   DO override `hashCode` if you override `==`.
*   DO make your `==` operator obey the mathematical rules of equality.
*   AVOID defining custom equality for mutable classes.
*   DON'T make the parameter to `==` nullable.

## Flutter Architecture Recommendations

### Separation of concerns

You should separate your app into a UI layer and a data layer. Within those layers, you should further separate logic into classes by responsibility.

1. Use clearly defined data and UI layers.
2. Use the repository pattern in the data layer.
3. Use ViewModels and Views in the UI layer. (MVVM)
4. Do not put logic in widgets.
5. Use a domain layer in complex logic environments.


### Handling data

1. Use unidirectional data flow.
2. Use `Commands` to handle events from user interaction.
3. Use immutable data models.
4. Use freezed or built_value to generate immutable data models if useful
5. Create separate API models and domain models in large Apps

### App structure

1. Use dependency injection (recommended package: `provider`).
2. Use standardized naming conventions for classes, files and directories (see below).
  * HomeViewModel
  * HomeScreen
  * UserRepository
  * ClientApiService
3. Use abstract repository classes


### Testing

1. Test architectural components separately, and together.
2. Use mocks and fakes to isolate components under test.
3. Use widget tests to test UI components.
