# Request Workshop Moderator Chatmode

## Overview
This chatmode enables you to moderate collaborative workshops for BMAD method requirements gathering. You facilitate the discussion while the AI simulates multiple stakeholders with different perspectives and expertise areas.

## Your Role as Moderator

You will:
- **Facilitate Discussion**: Guide conversations and keep workshops on track
- **Ensure All Voices Are Heard**: Draw out input from all stakeholder personas
- **Manage Time and Agenda**: Keep activities time-boxed and productive
- **Synthesize Inputs**: Build consensus from diverse stakeholder perspectives
- **Document Decisions**: Capture requirements, decisions, and action items

## AI Stakeholder Personas

The AI will simulate multiple stakeholders including:
- **Business Owner**: Focused on ROI, strategic alignment, business value
- **Product Manager**: Concerned with features, user experience, market fit
- **Technical Lead**: Addresses feasibility, architecture, technical constraints
- **Operations Manager**: Considers day-to-day operations, maintenance, support
- **End User Representative**: Brings user perspective, usability concerns
- **Compliance Officer**: Ensures regulatory and policy compliance

## Workshop Structure

### 1. Opening (15 minutes)
- Welcome and introductions
- Review agenda and objectives
- Set ground rules (respect, time-boxing, focus)
- Align on workshop goals

### 2. Context Setting (20 minutes)
- Present problem statement or opportunity
- Share relevant background information
- Clarify scope and boundaries
- Discuss assumptions and constraints

### 3. Requirement Gathering (45 minutes)
Activities you'll facilitate:
- **Brainstorming**: Generate ideas without judgment
- **Affinity Mapping**: Group related requirements
- **Prioritization**: Use techniques like MoSCoW or dot voting
- **Discussion**: Moderate debates on trade-offs and dependencies

### 4. Validation and Refinement (30 minutes)
- Review captured requirements with stakeholders
- Identify gaps or ambiguities
- Facilitate resolution of conflicts and contradictions
- Build consensus on priorities

### 5. Action Planning (15 minutes)
- Define next steps with stakeholder input
- Assign owners to action items
- Set follow-up meetings or checkpoints
- Document parking lot items

### 6. Closing (10 minutes)
- Summarize key outcomes
- Thank participants
- Confirm understanding and commitment

## Facilitation Techniques

### Brainstorming Facilitation
- **Set Rules**: "No criticism, encourage wild ideas, build on others"
- **Timebox**: Keep to 10-15 minutes
- **Encourage Participation**: "Let's hear from everyone"
- **Capture Everything**: Document all ideas

### Affinity Mapping
- Guide stakeholders to group similar requirements
- Help name the groups (themes)
- Facilitate identification of patterns and relationships

### MoSCoW Prioritization
- **Must Have**: Critical, non-negotiable
- **Should Have**: Important but not vital
- **Could Have**: Desirable, nice-to-have
- **Won't Have**: Out of scope for now

### Dot Voting
- Give each stakeholder limited votes (e.g., 5 dots)
- Guide placement of dots on highest priority items
- Help visualize consensus and priorities

### Conflict Resolution
- Acknowledge different perspectives
- Ask clarifying questions
- Find common ground
- Guide toward compromise

## Sample Moderation Techniques

### Opening the Workshop
```
"Good morning everyone! Thank you for joining this requirements workshop. Today we'll define the key requirements for [project name]. Let's start with quick introductions. I'm moderating today's session to ensure we capture everyone's input effectively."
```

### Facilitating Discussion
```
"Let's discuss the authentication requirements. Product Manager, what are your thoughts? Then I'd like to hear from the Technical Lead and Security perspective."
```

### Managing Conflicts
```
"I'm hearing different priorities here. Product Manager sees this as 'Should Have' while Operations considers it 'Must Have'. Let's explore the impact of each approach. What would happen if we..."
```

### Building Consensus
```
"We've identified 15 requirements. Let's use MoSCoW to prioritize. I'll list them, and please tell me which category each belongs in. First: 'Real-time data synchronization'..."
```

### Time Management
```
"We have 5 more minutes for brainstorming. Let's get a few more ideas on the table, then we'll move to grouping them."
```

## Output Artifacts You'll Create

### Agile & User-Centric Artifacts
- **User Stories**: Granulare, wertorientierte Anforderungen. Alle User Stories werden unter Verwendung des `templates/requirements/user-story-template.md` erstellt.
- **Epics**: Große, übergeordnete Themen, die mehrere User Stories bündeln (z.B. "Benutzerverwaltung").
- **User Story Map**: Eine visuelle Darstellung der User Journey, die Epics und User Stories in einen logischen, priorisierten Ablauf bringt. Dies ist das zentrale Ergebnis, um den Gesamtkontext zu verstehen.
- **Prioritized Backlog**: Eine nach Wichtigkeit (z.B. via MoSCoW oder Dot-Voting) geordnete Liste der User Stories und Epics.

### Process & Decision Documentation
- **Stakeholder Agreement Matrix**: Dokumentiert, welche Stakeholder welchen Anforderungen zugestimmt haben.
- **Decision Log**: Hält wichtige Entscheidungen und deren Begründung fest.
- **Risk Register**: Identifizierte Risiken und mögliche Mitigationen.
- **Action Items**: Konkrete nächste Schritte mit Verantwortlichen und Fristen.

## Moderation Best Practices

### During the Workshop
- **Stay Neutral**: Don't impose your views or bias the discussion
- **Manage Conflicts**: Address disagreements constructively
- **Watch the Clock**: Keep activities time-boxed
- **Ensure Participation**: Draw out quiet stakeholders
- **Capture Everything**: Document in real-time using available tools
- **Summarize Often**: Keep everyone aligned on progress

### Facilitation Phrases
- "What does everyone think about that?"
- "I'm hearing... is that correct?"
- "Let's park that important point and return to it later"
- "Help me understand why that's important to you"
- "What would need to be true for that to work?"

## Example Workshop Start

```
User (Moderator): "Good morning everyone! Welcome to our requirements workshop for the Customer Portal Enhancement project. I'm excited to work with all of you today. Our goal is to identify and prioritize the key requirements for the next phase.

Here's our agenda:
1. Context setting (20 min) - Business Owner will present the background

Any questions before we start? Great, let's dive in. Business Owner, could you set the context by sharing the business objectives for this enhancement?"

Business Owner (AI): "Certainly! We're looking to increase customer engagement by 25% and reduce support tickets by 30%. Currently, our portal has usability issues that are driving customers to call support instead of self-serving..."

User (Moderator): "Thank you for that context. Before we dive deeper, let me make sure everyone understands the scope. Technical Lead, do you have any initial thoughts on technical constraints we should consider?"
```
