## Sample Participation Examples

### Introduction
```
User (Security Architect): "Hi everyone, I'm the Security Architect joining today's workshop. My main focus is ensuring we build security into the design from the start rather than bolting it on later. I'm particularly concerned about data privacy, access controls, and regulatory compliance. Looking forward to collaborating with you all!"

Facilitator (AI): "Welcome! Thank you for joining us. Your security perspective will be crucial. We'll make sure to address those concerns as we define the requirements."
```

### Contributing Requirements
```
User (Product Manager): "From a user experience perspective, we absolutely need single sign-on. Our user research shows that managing multiple passwords is the #1 complaint. It's causing 40% of our support calls. This has to be a 'Must Have' requirement."

Technical Lead (AI): "I agree SSO is important, but we need to consider the implementation complexity. OAuth 2.0 integration will add 3-4 weeks to the timeline."

User (Product Manager): "I understand the timeline concern, but the user adoption risk is too high without SSO. Could we perhaps start with a simpler SSO implementation and enhance it later?"
```

### Negotiating Priorities
```
Operations Manager (AI): "Real-time data synchronization is critical from an operations perspective. Our current delays are causing customer complaints."

User (Business Owner): "I hear your concern, but real-time sync will increase our infrastructure costs by 30%. What if we implemented near-real-time with 5-minute delays? Would that address most operational issues while managing costs?"

Facilitator (AI): "Let's explore this trade-off. Operations Manager, what specific issues would a 5-minute delay cause? Business Owner, what cost impact would be acceptable?"
```

### Building Consensus
```
User (End User Rep): "I've been listening to everyone's points about the reporting features. While real-time reports would be nice, I think the Operations Manager is right that scheduled reports could meet 80% of our needs. As long as we can get daily summaries automatically, that would solve our main pain points."

Technical Lead (AI): "That's helpful perspective. Scheduled reports are much simpler to implement and wouldn't impact system performance."

Business Owner (AI): "I like this compromise. It addresses the core need while keeping costs reasonable."
```

## Example Workshop Session

```
Facilitator (AI): "Let's begin our requirements workshop for the Customer Data Platform. We have representatives from several key areas. Let's start with introductions. Business Owner?"

Business Owner (AI): "Hi everyone. I'm focused on improving our customer insights to drive revenue growth. We need better data integration and analytics capabilities."

User (Data Privacy Officer): "Hello, I'm the Data Privacy Officer. My priority is ensuring we handle customer data in full compliance with GDPR and other regulations. Any solution must have robust privacy controls and audit capabilities."

Technical Lead (AI): "I'm the Technical Lead. I'm concerned about scalability and integration with our existing systems. We need to avoid creating more technical debt."

Facilitator (AI): "Excellent. Now let's dive into the current challenges. Business Owner, what specific data problems are we trying to solve?"

User (Data Privacy Officer): "Before we get into solutions, can I add that we've had two compliance audits this year, and data handling was flagged both times? Whatever we implement needs to address those audit findings first."
```

Your participation as a stakeholder will help ensure that the final requirements truly reflect the needs of all user groups and can be successfully implemented and adopted.
